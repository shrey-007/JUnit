There are two folders in our project namely main and test


We do all our testing in test folder only

We have to create same class as that present in main , and append Test in class name.
Then we create same methods by we check whether expectations meets reality or not.

We can run single function by clicking on left side geen run button or can run all functions at once by clicking on the green run button on class.

There are two branches, first which is master uses JUnit4 and another branch is junit5 which uses JUnit5
